# PROBLEMS
**EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED**
The module header says that `a2!` is exposed, but it is not defined anywhere in this module.

**app.md:3:2:3:5:**
```roc
	a2!
```
	^^^
You can fix this by either defining `a2!` in this module, or by removing it from the list of exposed values.

**EXPOSED BUT NOT DEFINED**
The module header says that `a1!` is exposed, but it is not defined anywhere in this module.

**app.md:2:2:2:5:**
```roc
	a1!,
```
	^^^
You can fix this by either defining `a1!` in this module, or by removing it from the list of exposed values.
